# controlling servo motor angle and calculating distance

# Description
   
   Controlling the servo motor angle and calculatind distance is a embbeded system used to control the servo motor which is basically a actuator by using the sensor component and other essentials components of circuital along with the microcontroller unit. And in addition with control unit it is also capable of the calacualting the distance or range of that obstacle.


# Identifying Features

 * Calaculating distance using ultrasonic sensor.
 * Controlling the servo motor angle.
 * Provides the motor angle and displaying it on LCD display.
 * Detects the object range in all possible direction.

 # State of art / Research

 *  controlling servo motor angle plays a important role in the calculating the distance and the      
    obstacle. Since the servo motor provides torque and velocity based on the supplied voltage and current. It is very comfortable to identify the range of the obstacle and it is a 360 degree rotating motor and with the help of the ultrasonic sensor it willl be achieved. A sensor also plays vital role in the detecting the objects.

# Abstract

* This embedded project uses the sensors and actuators as a part of component building. The ultrasonic 
  sensors which are capable of the detecting the objects can be further improvised and may include in the designing of a smart parking system which is automated one. And the servo motor which can precisely used in controlling the motor angle must be in the range f the calculated distance.
