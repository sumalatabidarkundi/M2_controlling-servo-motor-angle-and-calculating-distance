## components 

## 1. Arduino UNO

* Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino 
  boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning display.

## 2. Ultrasonic sensor

* An ultrasonic sensor is a sensor that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound 
  waves.
* It recieves and transmitts the ultrasonic signals.

## 3. Servo motor

*  servomotor  is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of 
   angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. 
* It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.

## 4.LCD display

* The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of display that uses the liquid crystals for its operation. 
   Here, we will accept the serial input from the computer and upload the sketch to the Arduino. The characters will be displayed on the LCD.

## 5.Potentiometer

* The potentiometer is a device that is used to measure the voltage or electric potential. It provides a 
   variable resistance when the shaft of the device is turned. Here, we will measure the amount of resistance as an analog value produced by the potentiometer.

## 6.Resistors

* limit the amount of current going to certain components in the circuit, such as LEDs and integrated 
  circuits.
