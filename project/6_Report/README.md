# controlling servo motor angle and calculating distance

# Description
   
   Controlling the servo motor angle and calculatind distance is a embbeded system used to control the servo motor which is basically a actuator by using the sensor component and other essentials components of circuital along with the microcontroller unit. And in addition with control unit it is also capable of the calacualting the distance or range of that obstacle.


# Identifying Features

 * Calaculating distance using ultrasonic sensor.
 * Controlling the servo motor angle.
 * Provides the motor angle and displaying it on LCD display.
 * Detects the object range in all possible direction.

 # State of art / Research

 *  controlling servo motor angle plays a important role in the calculating the distance and the      
    obstacle. Since the servo motor provides torque and velocity based on the supplied voltage and current. It is very comfortable to identify the range of the obstacle and it is a 360 degree rotating motor and with the help of the ultrasonic sensor it willl be achieved. A sensor also plays vital role in the detecting the objects.

# Abstract

* This embedded project uses the sensors and actuators as a part of component building. The ultrasonic 
  sensors which are capable of the detecting the objects can be further improvised and may include in the designing of a smart parking system which is automated one. And the servo motor which can precisely used in controlling the motor angle must be in the range f the calculated distance.

## components 

## 1. Arduino UNO Unit

* Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino 
  boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning display.

## 2. Ultrasonic sensor

* An ultrasonic sensor is a sensor that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound 
  waves.
* It recieves and transmitts the ultrasonic signals.

## 3. Servo motor

*  servomotor  is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of 
   angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. 
* It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.

## 4.LCD display

* The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of display that uses the liquid crystals for its operation. 
   Here, we will accept the serial input from the computer and upload the sketch to the Arduino. The characters will be displayed on the LCD.

## 5.Potentiometer

* The potentiometer is a device that is used to measure the voltage or electric potential. It provides a 
   variable resistance when the shaft of the device is turned. Here, we will measure the amount of resistance as an analog value produced by the potentiometer.

## 6.Resistors

* limit the amount of current going to certain components in the circuit, such as LEDs and integrated 
  circuits.
